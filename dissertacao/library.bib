abstract = {Different physics-based negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) models as proposed in the literature are reviewed, and the predictive capability of these models is benchmarked against experimental data. Models that focus exclusively on hole trapping in gate-insulator-process-related preexisting traps are found to be inconsistent with direct experimental evidence of interface trap generation. Models that focus exclusively on interface trap generation are incapable of predicting ultrafast measurement data. Models that assume strong correlation between interface trap generation and hole trapping in switching hole traps cannot simultaneously predict long-time dc stress, recovery, and ac stress and cannot estimate gate insulator process impact. Uncorrelated contributions from generation and recovery of interface traps, together with hole trapping and detrapping in preexisting and newly generated bulk insulator traps, are invoked to comprehensively predict dc stress and recovery, ac duty cycle and frequency, and gate insulator process impact of NBTI. The reaction–diffusion model can accurately predict generation and recovery of interface traps for different devices and experimental conditions. Hole trapping/detrapping is modeled using a two-level energy well model.},

abstract = {A thermochemical/molecular model is developed for breakdown in high dielectric constant materials and the model suggests that a fundamental relationship exists between dielectric breakdown strength (Ebd) and dielectric constant (k). The model indicates that Ebd should show an approximate (k)-1/2 dependence over a wide range of high dielectric constant materials. The model also predicts that the field-acceleration parameter ($\gamma$), from time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) testing, should increase with dielectric constant. TDDB and Ebd data are presented for model support. The thermochemical model suggests that the very high local electric field (Lorentz-relation/Mossotti-field) in high-k dielectrics tends to distort/weaken the polar molecular bonds making them more susceptible to bond breakage by standard Boltzmann processes and/or by hole capture and thus lowers the breakdown strength. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We show that positive charge trapping is a dominant process when ultra-thick oxides are stressed through the ramped voltage test. Exploiting the physics behind positive charge generation/trapping at high electric fields, a fast I-V measurement technique is proposed that can be used to effectively distinguish the ultra-thick oxides' intrinsic quality at low electric fields.

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

abstract = {Transistor aging due to Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) is one of the major reliability issues of VLSI circuits fabricated at nanometer technology nodes. Transistor aging increases the circuit delay over the time and ultimately leads to lifetime reduction of VLSI chips. Accurate aging-aware timing analysis is a key requirement to consider these effects in the design cycle. Our analysis shows that a separate (independent) analysis of different sources of aging leads to significant overestimation of post-aging delay. To overcome the problem of existing methods, we propose a new aging-aware gate delay model that precisely captures the combined effect of different aging sources on delay. Our results obtained from a set of benchmark circuits show that, our proposed gate-delay model estimates the aging-induced $\Delta$delay by 7.8{\%} (translating to 36.0{\%} MTTF) more accurately in comparison to prior techniques. Moreover, we present a flow for integrating the proposed gate delay model with commercial timing analysis tools.},

abstract = {Abstract—As CMOS technology scales down into the nanome- ter regime, designers have to add pessimistic timing margins to the circuit as guardbands to avoid timing violations due to various reliability effects, in particular accelerated transistor aging. Since aging is workload-dependent, the aging rates of different paths are non-uniform, and hence, design time delay-balanced circuits become significantly unbalanced after some operational time. In this paper, an aging-aware logic synthesis approach is proposed to increase circuit lifetime with respect to a specific guardband. Our main objective is to optimize the design timing with respect to post-aging delay in a way that all paths reach the assigned guardband at the same time. In this regard, in an iterative process, after computing the post-aging delays, the lifetime is improved by putting tighter timing constraints on paths with higher aging rate and looser constraints on paths which have less post-aging delay than the desired guarband. The experimental results shows that the proposed approach improves circuit lifetime in average by more than 3X with negligible impact on area. Our approach is implemented on top of a commercial synthesis toolchain, and hence scales very well.},

abstract = {A universal guideline and state-of-the-art hot-carrier effects in scaled MOSFETs are reviewed and discussed from the viewpoints of 1) DC and AC hot-carrier effects, 2) hot-carrier detrapping phenomena, 3) mechanical stress effects on hot-carrier phenomena, and 4) hot-carrier resistant device structures. In the deep-submicron region, the hot-carrier applicable voltage is less than 3 V, so AC hot-carrier effects from the dynamic operation of actual circuits should be taken into account. Despite much experimentation and analysis, there is still no universally accepted theory that explain the AC degradation mechanism. This is because the noise caused by the wiring inductance in ULSI circuits and in measurement systems screens the intrinsic AC hot-carrier effects. Here, AC hot-carrier degradation enhanced by gate pulse-induced-noise is analyzed experimentally and theoretically. After eliminating the noise problem, it is found that AC hot-carrier degradation in LDD (Lightly doped drain) and GOLD (gate-drain overlapped device) structures can be estimated based on DC degradation in terms of the effective stress time which takes the duty ratio into account. In addition, it is found that the noise is negligible when the wiring inductance is smaller that 80 nH (250 m??), which is important for future circuit design. Furthermore, hot-carrier detrapping effects, especially in p-channel MOS devices, and hot-carrier phenomena under mechanical stress are investigated experimentally to better understand the underlying hot-carrier physics. Finally, future hot-carrier resistant device structures are discussed. ?? 1993.},

Molecular dielectric degradation models, which lead to percolation path generation and eventual TDDB failure, tend to fall into three broad categories: field-based models, current-based models, and complementary combinations of field and current-based models. A complementary combination of field-induced polar-bond stretching and current-induced bond-catalysis seems to be required, at the molecular level, to explain the generally accepted TDDB observations. Thus, TDDB modeling is not simply the use of field or current – but both. Complementary combinations of field and current are required to fully explain the generally accepted TDDB observations.},

The de facto modeling method to analyze CHC is based on substrate current Isub, which becomes increasingly problematic with technology scaling as various leakage components dominate Isub. In this paper, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions for both NBTI and CHC effects. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions. Models are comprehensively verified with an industrial 65-nm technology. By benchmarking the prediction of circuit performance degradation with the measured ring oscillator data and simulations of an amplifier, we demonstrate that the proposed method very well predicts the degradation. For 65-nm technology, NBTI is the dominant reliability concern, and the impact of CHC on circuit performance is relatively small.},

abstract = {The properties of the so-called time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of silicon dioxide-based gate dielectric for microelectronics technology have been investigated and reviewed. Experimental data covering a wide range of oxide thickness, stress voltage, temperature, and for the two bias polarities were gathered using structures with a wide range of gate oxide areas, and over very long stress times. Thickness dependence of oxide breakdown was shown to be in excellent agreement with statistical models founded in the percolation theory which explain the drastic reduction of the time-to-breakdown with decreasing oxide thickness. The voltage dependence of time-to-breakdown was found to follow a power-law behavior rather than an exponential law as commonly assumed. Our investigation on the inter-relationship between voltage and temperature dependencies of oxide breakdown reveals that a strong temperature activation with non-Arrhenius behavior is consistent with the power-law voltage dependence. The power-law voltage dependence in combination with strong temperature activation provides the most important reliability relief in compensation for the strong decrease of time-to-breakdown resulting from the reduction of the oxide thickness. Using the maximum energy of injected electrons at the anode interface as breakdown variable, we have resolved the polarity gap of time- and charge-to-breakdown (TBD and QBD), confirming that the fluency and the electron energy at anode interface are the fundamental quantities controlling oxide breakdown. Combining this large database with a recently proposed cell-based analytical version of the percolation model, we extract the defect generation efficiency responsible for breakdown. Following a review of different breakdown mechanisms and models, we discuss how the release of hydrogen through the coupling between vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom can explain the power-law dependence of defect generation efficiency. On the basis of these results, a unified and global picture of oxide breakdown is constructed and the resulting model is applied to project reliability limits. In this regard, it is concluded that SiO2-based dielectrics can provide reliable gate dielectric, even to a thickness of 1nm, and that CMOS scaling may well be viable for the 50nm technology node.},

In such cases, designers devise mechanisms and architectures that allow the system to either completely mask the effects of a component failure or recover from it so quickly that the application is not seriously affected. This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of mission critical applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind. Reflecting the real-world challenges faced by designers of these systems, this book addresses fault tolerance design with a systems approach to both hardware and software. No other text on the market takes this approach, nor offers the comprehensive and up-to-date treatment Koren and Krishna provide. Students, designers and architects of high performance processors will value this comprehensive overview of the field. * The first book on fault tolerance design with a systems approach * Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software fault tolerance, as well as information and time redundancy * Incorporated case studies highlight six different computer systems with fault-tolerance techniques implemented in their design * Available to lecturers is a complete ancillary package including online solutions manual for instructors and PowerPoint slides.

Additionally, the presence of hydrogen gettering sites such as unsaturated grain bound- aries significantly enhance NBTI degradation, whereas hydrogen sources reduce NBTI degradation. The model also suggests the possible mechanisms for saturation. The model is calibrated over a range of stress temperatures and voltages.

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

This task is accomplished with a pair of modified ring oscillators (ROSCs) which are representative of standard CMOS circuits. We use a ¿backdrive¿ concept, in which one ROSC drives the voltage transitions in both structures during stress, such that the driving oscillator ages due to both BTI and HCI, while the other suffers from only BTI. In addition, long term or high voltage experiments facilitate TDDB measurements in both oscillators. Sub-¿s measurements are controlled by on-chip logic in order to avoid excessive unwanted BTI recovery during stress interruptions. Sub-ps frequency resolution is achieved during these short measurements using a beat frequency detection system, and we automate the experiments through a simple digital interface.

Design rules, operating voltages, frequencies, and temperatures are precisely chosen to ensure correct product functional operation over its intended lifetime. Thus, in order to obtain the overall performance and functionality bounded by various design and manufacturing constraints, the integrated circuit reliability must be modeled and analyzed at the very beginning of design stages. This paper reviews some of the most important intrinsic wearout mechanisms of MOSFETs (including hot-carrier injection, time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and negative bias temperature instability) and introduces new accelerated-lifetime and SPICE compact models of these wearout mechanisms. Based on these circuit-aging models, a new SPICE reliability simulation approach is proposed and demonstrated with a simplified SRAM design on a commercial 90-nm technology to help designers understand device-failure behaviors, predict circuit reliability, and improve product robustness.},

abstract = {Semiconductor chips are used today not only to control systems, but also to protect them against security threats. A continuous battle is waged between manufacturers who invent new security solutions, learning their lessons from previous mistakes, and the hacker community, constantly trying to break implemented protections. Some chip manufacturers do not pay enough attention to the proper design and testing of protection mechanisms. Even where they claim their products are highly secure, they do not guarantee this and do not take any responsibility if a device is compromised. In this situation, it is crucial for the design engineer to have a convenient and reliable method of testing secure chips. This thesis presents a wide range of attacks on hardware security in microcontrollers and smartcards. This includes already known non-invasive attacks, such as power analysis and glitching, and invasive attacks, such as reverse engineering and microprobing. A new class of attacks – semi-invasive attacks – is introduced. Like invasive attacks, they require depackaging the chip to get access to its surface. But the passivation layer remains intact, as these methods do not require electrical contact to internal lines. Semi-invasive attacks stand between noninvasive and invasive attacks. They represent a greater threat to hardware security, as they are almost as effective as invasive attacks but can be low-cost like non-invasive attacks. This thesis' contribution includes practical fault-injection attacks to modify SRAM and EEPROM content, or change the state of any individual CMOS transistor on a chip. This leads to almost unlimited capabilities to control chip operation and circumvent protection mechanisms. A second contribution consist of experiments on data remanence, which show that it is feasible to extract information from powered-off SRAM and erased EPROM, EEPROM and Flash memory devices. A brief introduction to copy protection in microcontrollers is given. Hardware security evaluation techniques using semi-invasive methods are introduced. They should help developers to make a proper selection of components according to the required level of security. Various defence technologies are discussed, from low-cost obscurity methods to new approaches in silicon design.},

PCA, as a dimension reduction methodology, is applied without the consideration of the correlation between the dependent variable and the independent variables, while PLS is applied based on the correlation. Therefore, we call PCA as an unsupervised dimension reduction methodology, and call PLS as a supervised dimension reduction methodology. We'll describe the algorithms of PCA and PLS, and compare their performances in multivariate regressions using simulated data.},

abstract = {-The ongoing evolution of the electric power systems brings about the need to cope with increasingly com-plex interactions of technical components and relevant ac-tors. In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical compo-nents such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the in-fluence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.},

By extending down to −30°C, we found non-Arrhenius temperature dependence is a totally independent effect. Based on our statistically accurate experimental database, we found that defect-generation rate and critical defect density as commonly measured using stress-induced leakage current (SILC) only show a change of two orders of magnitude and no change, respectively. Weibull slopes are also found to be temperature-independent. We propose an alternative model of two-step hydrogen degradation to explain these experimental results.},

When used with condition-based maintenance, EP promises to significantly increase the effective mean-time-between system failures (MTBF) by predicting and avoiding system failures (maintenance planned based on condition). Increased MTBF numbers translate into enhanced availability and better operational reliability. This is essential for building highly dependable computing systems. This paper briefly reviews the steps required for achieving successful prognostics. The lessons learned from adopting EP to the previous and current generations of enterprise computing systems have influenced the next generation computer system designs, equipping future systems with more advanced capabilities for electronic prognostics. Sun Microsystems' new continuous system telemetry harness (CSTH) coupled with advanced pattern recognition substantially increases component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing (through improved root cause analysis) costly sources of "no trouble found" events. These "no trouble found" events have become a significant warranty-cost issue for COTS and a sparing-logistics issue for mil spec electronic systems},

abstract = {Design for reliability is becoming an important step in the design cycle with CMOS technology scaling, demanding need for efficient and accurate reliability simulation methods in the design stage. Traditional aging analysis does not differentiate NBTI induced delay shift in rising and falling edges, thereby assuming averaging effect due to recovery. It is essential to identify the critical operation conditions that are more susceptible to timing violations under aging. In this paper, by identifying the critical moments in circuit operation and considering the asymmetric aging effects, timing violations under NBTI effect are correctly predicted. The unique features of this work include: (1) delay modeling of a digital gate due to threshold voltage (Vth) shift using delay dependence on supply voltage from cell library; (2) asymmetric aging analysis is conducted by recognizing the critical points in circuit operation; and (3) setup and hold timing violations due to NBTI induced path delay shift in logic and clock buffer are investigated. This failure assessment method is further demonstrated in ISCAS89 benchmark circuits using 45nm Nangate standard cell library to extract aging information in critical paths. The proposed failure diagnosis enables resilient design techniques to mitigate circuit aging under NBTI.},

Our framework introduces dynamic cooling as one of the self-tuning parameters, in addition to supply voltage and clock frequency. Our optimized self-tuning satisfies performance constraints at all times and maximizes a lifetime computational power efficiency (LCPE) metric, which is defined as the total number of clock cycles achieved over lifetime divided by the total energy consumed over lifetime. Our framework features three control policies: 1. Progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2. Progressive-on-state-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep mode, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; 3. Progressive-real-time-aging-assisted (PRTA), which estimates the actual amount of aging and initiates optimized control action. Simulation results on benchmark circuits, using aging models validated by 45nm CMOS stress measurements, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach. We also analyze design constraints and derive system design guidelines to maximize self-tuning benefits. {\textcopyright} 2010 EDAA.},

With aggresive transistor scaling and increasing processor power and temperature, reliability due to wear-out mechanisms is expected to become a significant issue in microprocessor design. Reliabil- ity awareness at the microarchitectural design stage will soon be a neccessity and RAMP provides a convenient abstraction to do so. RAMPmodels chipwidemean time to failure as a function of the failure rates of individual structures on chip due to different failure mechanisms, and can be used to evaluate the reliability implications of different applications, architectural features, and processor designs. RAMP is a self-standing module which can be attached to architectural simulators which gener- ate power and temperature measurements, and has currently been ported to IBM's Turandot processor simulator and the RSIMarchitectural simulator.},

In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration. In this paper, we review the history of software reliability engineering, the current trends and existing problems, and specific difficulties. Possible future directions and promising research subjects in software reliability engineering are also addressed.},

With enormous complexity and significantly increased vulnerability to failures compared to the past, future system designs cannot rely on such assumptions. For coming generations of silicon technologies, several causes of hardware reliability failures, largely benign in the past, are becoming significant at the system level. Robust system design is essential to ensure that future systems perform correctly despite rising complexity and increasing disturbances. This paper describes three techniques that can enable a sea change in robust system design through cost-effective tolerance and prediction of failures in hardware during system operation: 1) efficient soft error resilience; 2) circuit failure prediction; and 3) effective on-line self-test and diagnostics. The need for global optimization across multiple abstraction layers is also demonstrated.},

Architects have translated the ever-increasing abundance of ever-faster transistors provided by Moore's law into remarkable increases in performance. Recently, however, the bounty provided by Moore's law has been accompanied by several challenges that have arisen as devices have become smaller, including a decrease in dependability due to physical faults. In this book, we focus on the dependability challenge and the fault tolerance solutions that architects are developing to overcome it. The two main purposes of this book are to explore the key ideas in fault-tolerant computer architecture and to present the current state-of-the-art - over approximately the past 10 years - in academia and industry.

The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

The user interface is modelled after the traditional formula interface, as exemplified by 1m. This was done so that people used to R would not have to learn yet another interface, and also because we believe the formula interface is a good way of working interactively with models. It thus has methods for generic functions like predict, update and coef. It also has more specialised functions like scores, loadings and RMSEP, and a flexible cross-validation system. Visual inspection and assessment is important in chemometrics, and the pls package has a number of plot functions for plotting scores, loadings, predictions, coefficients and RMSEP estimates. The package implements PCR and several algorithms for PLSR. The design is modular, so that it should be easy to use the underlying algorithms in other functions. It is our hope that the package will serve well both for interactive data analysis and as a building block for other functions or packages using PLSR or PCR. We will here describe the package and how it is used for data analysis, as well as how it can be used as a part of other packages. Also included is a section about formulas and data frames, for people not used to the R modelling idioms.},

abstract = {The scaling trends in CMOS technology and operating conditions give rise to serious degradation mechanisms such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) in MOSFETs, threatening the circuit and product lifetimes. The aging phenomena, on top of process variations, translate into complexity and reduced design margin for circuits. International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors mentions reliability as one of the "Design Technology Challenges" and calls attention to "Design for Reliability." In order to increase the overall design efficiency, it is important to (i) understand MOSFET-level degradation, (ii) develop physically robust compact models compatible with circuit simulators, and (iii) implementing tools that incorporate NBTI and HCI reliability into VLSI design process at an early stage. In this work, NBTI and HCI degradation and their implications on MOSFET and circuit reliability are studied. Transistor-level NBTI degradation is explored and experimentally calibrated voltage, temperature, and time dependences are obtained. Recovery characteristics, degradation under AC and random activity relations are derived. Implications for aggressively-scaled and non-planar MOSFET geometries are discussed. With comprehensive experimental and theoretical tools, HCI degradation is investigated, particularly for short channel MOSFETs with lower operating conditions. HCI issues that are unclear in the literature are resolved. The interface trap generation under HCI is linked to NBTI theory, thus degradation of circuits experiencing both mechanisms can be assessed efficiently. Finally, compact reliability models for MOSFETs are presented so that this framework can be applied to digital and analog circuits as well as memory circuits.},

Therefore, we developed a simulation model for NBTI degradation including its recovery effects and an implementation of this NBTI model in a SPICE environment. With this toolset, a fast characterization of different circuit topologies is possible. The simulation model covers both DC- and AC-stress. The model is applied to analyze a comparator in switched-capacitor technique. In spite of offset compensation by auto-zeroing, it shows erroneous behavior due to the fast recovering part of the $\Delta$Vth shift.},

abstract = {The underlying physics behind the success of the thermochemical E model in describing time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) in SiO2 thin films is presented. Weak bonding states can be broken by thermal means due to the strong dipolar coupling of intrinsic defect states with the local electric field in the dielectric. This dipole-field coupling serves to lower the activation energy required for thermal bond-breakage and accelerates the dielectric degradation process. A temperature-independent field acceleration parameter $\gamma$ and a field-independent activation energy $\Delta$H can result when different types of disturbed bonding states are mixed during TDDB testing of SiO2 thin films. While $\gamma$ for each defect type alone has the expected 1/T dependence and $\Delta$H shows a linear decrease with electric field, a nearly temperature-independent $\gamma$ and a field-independent $\Delta$H can result when two or more types of disturbed bonding states are mixed. The good agreement between long-term TDDB data and the thermochemical model suggest strongly that the oxygen vacancy is an important intrinsic defect for breakdown and that field, not current, is the primary cause of TDDB under low-field conditions. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The NBTI sensor proposed is intended to be used for general NBTI characterization and not in- situ monitoring of degradation, due to large area overhead ({\~{}}450x area of NBTI sensor in this work), inability to correct for temperature variations encountered during operation and the analog output of the sensor. We introduce two compact structures to digitally quantify the change in performance and power of devices undergoing NBTI and defect-induced oxide breakdown. The small size of the sensors makes them amenable to use in a standard-cell design with low area and power overhead. The sensors can be implemented in large numbers to collect data on degradation and statistical performance of the devices.},

abstract = {This volume addresses the issues related to hot-carrier reliability of MOS VLSI circuits, ranging from device physics to circuit design guidelines. It presents a unified view of the physical mechanisms involved in hot-carrier induced device degradation, the prevalent models for these mechanisms, and simulation methods for estimating hot-carrier effects in the circuit environment. The newly emerging approaches to the VLSI design-for-reliability and rule-based reliability diagnosis are also discussed in detail. Hot-Carrier Reliability of MOS VLSI Circuits is primarily for use by engineers and scientists who study device and circuit-level reliability in VLSI systems and develop practical reliability measures and models. VLSI designers will benefit from this book since it offers a comprehensive overview of the interacting mechanisms that influence hot-carrier reliability, and also provides useful guidelines for reliable VLSI design. This volume can be used as an advanced textbook or reference for a graduate-level course on VLSI reliability. 1. Introduction -- 1.1. The Concept of IC Reliability -- 1.2.

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a modified version of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which is a very successful feature extraction method for classification problems. In the proposed method, the between class and the within class scatter matrices in LDA are modified so that they fit in regression problems. The samples with small differences in the target values are used to constitute the within class scatter ma-trix while the ones with large differences in the target values are used for the between class scatter matrix. We have applied the proposed method in estimat-ing the head pose and compared the performance with the conventional feature extraction methods.},

Next we discuss some of the models that have been proposed for both NBTI degradation and recovery and p- versus n-MOSFETs. We also address the time and energy dependence effects of NBTI and crystal orientation. Finally we mention some aspect of circuit degradation. The general conclusion is that although we understand much about NBTI, several aspects are poorly understood. This may be due to a lack of a basic understanding or due to varying experimental data that are likely the result of sample preparation and measurement conditions. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have sug-gested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its mean-ing, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model perfor-mance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satis-fies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},
