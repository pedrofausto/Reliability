abstract = {-The ongoing evolution of the electric power systems brings about the need to cope with increasingly com-plex interactions of technical components and relevant ac-tors. In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical compo-nents such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the in-fluence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.},

abstract = {Software reliability engineering is focused on engineering techniques for developing and maintaining software systems whose reliability can be quantitatively evaluated. In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration. In this paper, we review the history of software reliability engineering, the current trends and existing problems, and specific difficulties. Possible future directions and promising research subjects in software reliability engineering are also addressed.},

Exploiting the physics behind positive charge generation/trapping at high electric fields, a fast I-V measurement technique is proposed that can be used to effectively distinguish the ultra-thick oxides' intrinsic quality at low electric fields.

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A universal guideline and state-of-the-art hot-carrier effects in scaled MOSFETs are reviewed and discussed from the viewpoints of 1) DC and AC hot-carrier effects, 2) hot-carrier detrapping phenomena, 3) mechanical stress effects on hot-carrier phenomena, and 4) hot-carrier resistant device structures. In the deep-submicron region, the hot-carrier applicable voltage is less than 3 V, so AC hot-carrier effects from the dynamic operation of actual circuits should be taken into account. Despite much experimentation and analysis, there is still no universally accepted theory that explain the AC degradation mechanism. This is because the noise caused by the wiring inductance in ULSI circuits and in measurement systems screens the intrinsic AC hot-carrier effects. Here, AC hot-carrier degradation enhanced by gate pulse-induced-noise is analyzed experimentally and theoretically. After eliminating the noise problem, it is found that AC hot-carrier degradation in LDD (Lightly doped drain) and GOLD (gate-drain overlapped device) structures can be estimated based on DC degradation in terms of the effective stress time which takes the duty ratio into account. In addition, it is found that the noise is negligible when the wiring inductance is smaller that 80 nH (250 m??), which is important for future circuit design. Furthermore, hot-carrier detrapping effects, especially in p-channel MOS devices, and hot-carrier phenomena under mechanical stress are investigated experimentally to better understand the underlying hot-carrier physics. Finally, future hot-carrier resistant device structures are discussed. ?? 1993.},

The model indicates that Ebd should show an approximate (k)-1/2 dependence over a wide range of high dielectric constant materials. The model also predicts that the field-acceleration parameter ($\gamma$), from time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) testing, should increase with dielectric constant. TDDB and Ebd data are presented for model support. The thermochemical model suggests that the very high local electric field (Lorentz-relation/Mossotti-field) in high-k dielectrics tends to distort/weaken the polar molecular bonds making them more susceptible to bond breakage by standard Boltzmann processes and/or by hole capture and thus lowers the breakdown strength. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Abstract For many years, most computer architects have pursued one primary goal: performance. Architects have translated the ever-increasing abundance of ever-faster transistors provided by Moore's law into remarkable increases in performance. Recently, however, the bounty provided by Moore's law has been accompanied by several challenges that have arisen as devices have become smaller, including a decrease in dependability due to physical faults. In this book, we focus on the dependability challenge and the fault tolerance solutions that architects are developing to overcome it. The two main purposes of this book are to explore the key ideas in fault-tolerant computer architecture and to present the current state-of-the-art - over approximately the past 10 years - in academia and industry.

abstract = {Semiconductor chips are used today not only to control systems, but also to protect them against security threats. A continuous battle is waged between manufacturers who invent new security solutions, learning their lessons from previous mistakes, and the hacker community, constantly trying to break implemented protections. Some chip manufacturers do not pay enough attention to the proper design and testing of protection mechanisms. Even where they claim their products are highly secure, they do not guarantee this and do not take any responsibility if a device is compromised. In this situation, it is crucial for the design engineer to have a convenient and reliable method of testing secure chips. This thesis presents a wide range of attacks on hardware security in microcontrollers and smartcards. This includes already known non-invasive attacks, such as power analysis and glitching, and invasive attacks, such as reverse engineering and microprobing. A new class of attacks – semi-invasive attacks – is introduced. Like invasive attacks, they require depackaging the chip to get access to its surface. But the passivation layer remains intact, as these methods do not require electrical contact to internal lines. Semi-invasive attacks stand between noninvasive and invasive attacks. They represent a greater threat to hardware security, as they are almost as effective as invasive attacks but can be low-cost like non-invasive attacks. This thesis' contribution includes practical fault-injection attacks to modify SRAM and EEPROM content, or change the state of any individual CMOS transistor on a chip. This leads to almost unlimited capabilities to control chip operation and circumvent protection mechanisms. A second contribution consist of experiments on data remanence, which show that it is feasible to extract information from powered-off SRAM and erased EPROM, EEPROM and Flash memory devices. A brief introduction to copy protection in microcontrollers is given. Hardware security evaluation techniques using semi-invasive methods are introduced. They should help developers to make a proper selection of components according to the required level of security. Various defence technologies are discussed, from low-cost obscurity methods to new approaches in silicon design.},

Different from most existing work that exploits emerging technologies for hardware security, we (i) focus on transistor characteristics that either do not exist in, or are difficult to duplicate with MOSFETs, and (ii) aim to move beyond hardware implementations of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and random number generators (RNGs).},

Next we discuss some of the models that have been proposed for both NBTI degradation and recovery and p- versus n-MOSFETs. We also address the time and energy dependence effects of NBTI and crystal orientation. Finally we mention some aspect of circuit degradation. The general conclusion is that although we understand much about NBTI, several aspects are poorly understood. This may be due to a lack of a basic understanding or due to varying experimental data that are likely the result of sample preparation and measurement conditions. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Circuit reliability is affected by various fabrication-time and run-time effects. Fabrication-induced process variation has significant impact on circuit performance and reliability. Various aging effects, such as negative bias temperature instability, cause continuous performance and reliability degradation during circuit run-time usage. In this work, we present a statistical analysis framework that characterizes the lifetime reliability of nanometer-scale integrated circuits by jointly considering the impact of fabrication-induced process variation and run-time aging effects. More specifically, our work focuses on characterizing circuit threshold voltage lifetime variation and its impact on circuit timing due to process variation and the negative bias temperature instability effect, a primary aging effect in nanometer-scale integrated circuits. The proposed work is capable of characterizing the overall circuit lifetime reliability, as well as efficiently quantifying the vulnerabilities of individual circuit elements. This analysis framework has been carefully validated and integrated into an iterative design flow for circuit lifetime reliability analysis and optimization.},

@article{Grasser2009,
abstract = {Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) is a serious reliability concern for pMOS transistors. Although discovered more than 40 years ago, the phenomenon remains highly controversial in both experimental and theoretical terms. A considerable number of recent publications suggest that NBTI is caused by the following two independent mechanisms: 1) generation of defects close to the silicon/silicon dioxide interface and 2) hole trapping in the oxide. We have performed stress and recovery experiments at different temperatures and voltages that, quite surprisingly, reveal that all data can be scaled onto a single universal curve during stress, recovery, and restress. This suggests that in our samples, NBTI is caused by either a single dominant mechanism, which is more complicated than previously anticipated, or that the previously suggested mechanisms, i.e., hole trapping and defect creation, are actually tightly coupled.},
