abstract = {Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) models for silica(SiO2){-}based dielectrics are revisited so as to better understand the ability of each model to explain quantitatively the generally accepted TDDB observations. Molecular dielectric degradation models, which lead to percolation path generation and eventual TDDB failure, tend to fall into three broad categories: field-based models, current-based models, and complementary combinations of field and current-based models. A complementary combination of field-induced polar-bond stretching and current-induced bond-catalysis seems to be required, at the molecular level, to explain the generally accepted TDDB observations. Thus, TDDB modeling is not simply the use of field or current {–} but both. Complementary combinations of field and current are required to fully explain the generally accepted TDDB observations.},

abstract = {Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and channel hot carrier (CHC) are the leading reliability concerns for nanoscale transistors. The de facto modeling method to analyze CHC is based on substrate current Isub, which becomes increasingly problematic with technology scaling as various leakage components dominate Isub. In this paper, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions for both NBTI and CHC effects. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions. Models are comprehensively verified with an industrial 65-nm technology. By benchmarking the prediction of circuit performance degradation with the measured ring oscillator data and simulations of an amplifier, we demonstrate that the proposed method very well predicts the degradation. For 65-nm technology, NBTI is the dominant reliability concern, and the impact of CHC on circuit performance is relatively small.},

@book{Sorin2009,
abstract = {Abstract For many years, most computer architects have pursued one primary goal: performance. Architects have translated the ever-increasing abundance of ever-faster transistors provided by Moore's law into remarkable increases in performance. Recently, however, the bounty provided by Moore's law has been accompanied by several challenges that have arisen as devices have become smaller, including a decrease in dependability due to physical faults. In this book, we focus on the dependability challenge and the fault tolerance solutions that architects are developing to overcome it. The two main purposes of this book are to explore the key ideas in fault-tolerant computer architecture and to present the current state-of-the-art - over approximately the past 10 years - in academia and industry.

abstract = {Software reliability engineering is focused on engineering techniques for developing and maintaining software systems whose reliability can be quantitatively evaluated. In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration. In this paper, we review the history of software reliability engineering, the current trends and existing problems, and specific difficulties. Possible future directions and promising research subjects in software reliability engineering are also addressed.},

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical compo-nents such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the in-fluence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.},

abstract = {Semiconductor chips are used today not only to control systems, but also to protect them against security threats. A continuous battle is waged between manufacturers who invent new security solutions, learning their lessons from previous mistakes, and the hacker community, constantly trying to break implemented protections. Some chip manufacturers do not pay enough attention to the proper design and testing of protection mechanisms. Even where they claim their products are highly secure, they do not guarantee this and do not take any responsibility if a device is compromised. In this situation, it is crucial for the design engineer to have a convenient and reliable method of testing secure chips. This thesis presents a wide range of attacks on hardware security in microcontrollers and smartcards. This includes already known non-invasive attacks, such as power analysis and glitching, and invasive attacks, such as reverse engineering and microprobing. A new class of attacks – semi-invasive attacks – is introduced. Like invasive attacks, they require depackaging the chip to get access to its surface. But the passivation layer remains intact, as these methods do not require electrical contact to internal lines. Semi-invasive attacks stand between noninvasive and invasive attacks. They represent a greater threat to hardware security, as they are almost as effective as invasive attacks but can be low-cost like non-invasive attacks. This thesis' contribution includes practical fault-injection attacks to modify SRAM and EEPROM content, or change the state of any individual CMOS transistor on a chip. This leads to almost unlimited capabilities to control chip operation and circumvent protection mechanisms. A second contribution consist of experiments on data remanence, which show that it is feasible to extract information from powered-off SRAM and erased EPROM, EEPROM and Flash memory devices. A brief introduction to copy protection in microcontrollers is given. Hardware security evaluation techniques using semi-invasive methods are introduced. They should help developers to make a proper selection of components according to the required level of security. Various defence technologies are discussed, from low-cost obscurity methods to new approaches in silicon design.},

A three mode interface trap generation is proposed based on the energy acquisition involved in distinct interactions in all the V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) conditions as a single I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} lifetime dependence is observed with V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} {\&}gt; 0. This gives a new age(t) function useful for accurate DC to AC transfers. Positive temperature activation is explained by the rise of ionization rate with electron-electron scattering (medium I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and multi vibrational excitation (higher I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) which increase the H desorption by thermal emission. The use of forward VBS has shown no gain under CHC for both device types. The main limitation occurs under reverse V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = -V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} in IO where the smaller temperature activation partially compensates the larger damage. In that case a security margin can be established giving a limit of V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = -V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/2 for design reliability.},

It presents a unified view of the physical mechanisms involved in hot-carrier induced device degradation, the prevalent models for these mechanisms, and simulation methods for estimating hot-carrier effects in the circuit environment. The newly emerging approaches to the VLSI design-for-reliability and rule-based reliability diagnosis are also discussed in detail. Hot-Carrier Reliability of MOS VLSI Circuits is primarily for use by engineers and scientists who study device and circuit-level reliability in VLSI systems and develop practical reliability measures and models. VLSI designers will benefit from this book since it offers a comprehensive overview of the interacting mechanisms that influence hot-carrier reliability, and also provides useful guidelines for reliable VLSI design.

abstract = {The scaling trends in CMOS technology and operating conditions give rise to serious degradation mechanisms such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) in MOSFETs, threatening the circuit and product lifetimes. The aging phenomena, on top of process variations, translate into complexity and reduced design margin for circuits. International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors mentions reliability as one of the "Design Technology Challenges" and calls attention to "Design for Reliability." In order to increase the overall design efficiency, it is important to (i) understand MOSFET-level degradation, (ii) develop physically robust compact models compatible with circuit simulators, and (iii) implementing tools that incorporate NBTI and HCI reliability into VLSI design process at an early stage. In this work, NBTI and HCI degradation and their implications on MOSFET and circuit reliability are studied. Transistor-level NBTI degradation is explored and experimentally calibrated voltage, temperature, and time dependences are obtained. Recovery characteristics, degradation under AC and random activity relations are derived. Implications for aggressively-scaled and non-planar MOSFET geometries are discussed. With comprehensive experimental and theoretical tools, HCI degradation is investigated, particularly for short channel MOSFETs with lower operating conditions. HCI issues that are unclear in the literature are resolved. The interface trap generation under HCI is linked to NBTI theory, thus degradation of circuits experiencing both mechanisms can be assessed efficiently. Finally, compact reliability models for MOSFETs are presented so that this framework can be applied to digital and analog circuits as well as memory circuits.},

This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of mission critical applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind.

Our framework introduces dynamic cooling as one of the self-tuning parameters, in addition to supply voltage and clock frequency. Our optimized self-tuning satisfies performance constraints at all times and maximizes a lifetime computational power efficiency (LCPE) metric, which is defined as the total number of clock cycles achieved over lifetime divided by the total energy consumed over lifetime. Our framework features three control policies: 1. Progressive-worst-case-aging (PWCA), which assumes worst-case aging at all times; 2. Progressive-on-state-aging (POSA), which estimates aging by tracking active/sleep mode, and then assumes worst-case aging in active mode and long recovery effects in sleep mode; 3. Progressive-real-time-aging-assisted (PRTA), which estimates the actual amount of aging and initiates optimized control action. Simulation results on benchmark circuits, using aging models validated by 45nm CMOS stress measurements, demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach. We also analyze design constraints and derive system design guidelines to maximize self-tuning benefits. {\textcopyright} 2010 EDAA.},

With enormous complexity and significantly increased vulnerability to failures compared to the past, future system designs cannot rely on such assumptions. For coming generations of silicon technologies, several causes of hardware reliability failures, largely benign in the past, are becoming significant at the system level. Robust system design is essential to ensure that future systems perform correctly despite rising complexity and increasing disturbances. This paper describes three techniques that can enable a sea change in robust system design through cost-effective tolerance and prediction of failures in hardware during system operation: 1) efficient soft error resilience; 2) circuit failure prediction; and 3) effective on-line self-test and diagnostics. The need for global optimization across multiple abstraction layers is also demonstrated.},

RAMPmodels chipwidemean time to failure as a function of the failure rates of individual structures on chip due to different failure mechanisms, and can be used to evaluate the reliability implications of different applications, architectural features, and processor designs. RAMP is a self-standing module which can be attached to architectural simulators which gener- ate power and temperature measurements, and has currently been ported to IBM's Turandot processor simulator and the RSIMarchitectural simulator.},

	abstract = {Reliability and robustness have been always important parameters of integrated systems. However, with the emergence of nanotechnologies reliabil-ity concerns are arising with an alarming pace. The consequence is an increas-ing demand of techniques that improve yield as well as lifetime reliability of to-day's complex integrated systems. It is requested though, that the solutions re-sult in only minimum penalties on power dissipation and system performance. The approach Alternating Module Activation (AMA) offers both extension of system lifetime and low increase of power and delay. The essential contribution of this work is an analysis to which extent this technique can be improved even more. Thereby, components that enable partial concurrent error detection as well as Built-in self-test functionality are included. Further, a flow for compari-son of system's lifetime on cell-level is presented. Final results indicate an im-provement of the system's lifetime of up to 58 {\%} for designs in which the ex-pected instance lifetime differs by factor 2.},

Additionally, the presence of hydrogen gettering sites such as unsaturated grain bound- aries significantly enhance NBTI degradation, whereas hydrogen sources reduce NBTI degradation. The model also suggests the possible mechanisms for saturation. The model is calibrated over a range of stress temperatures and voltages.

By extending down to −30°C, we found non-Arrhenius temperature dependence is a totally independent effect. Based on our statistically accurate experimental database, we found that defect-generation rate and critical defect density as commonly measured using stress-induced leakage current (SILC) only show a change of two orders of magnitude and no change, respectively. Weibull slopes are also found to be temperature-independent. We propose an alternative model of two-step hydrogen degradation to explain these experimental results.},

	abstract = {The properties of the so-called time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of silicon dioxide-based gate dielectric for microelectronics technology have been investigated and reviewed. Experimental data covering a wide range of oxide thickness, stress voltage, temperature, and for the two bias polarities were gathered using structures with a wide range of gate oxide areas, and over very long stress times. Thickness dependence of oxide breakdown was shown to be in excellent agreement with statistical models founded in the percolation theory which explain the drastic reduction of the time-to-breakdown with decreasing oxide thickness. The voltage dependence of time-to-breakdown was found to follow a power-law behavior rather than an exponential law as commonly assumed. Our investigation on the inter-relationship between voltage and temperature dependencies of oxide breakdown reveals that a strong temperature activation with non-Arrhenius behavior is consistent with the power-law voltage dependence. The power-law voltage dependence in combination with strong temperature activation provides the most important reliability relief in compensation for the strong decrease of time-to-breakdown resulting from the reduction of the oxide thickness. Using the maximum energy of injected electrons at the anode interface as breakdown variable, we have resolved the polarity gap of time- and charge-to-breakdown (TBD and QBD), confirming that the fluency and the electron energy at anode interface are the fundamental quantities controlling oxide breakdown. Combining this large database with a recently proposed cell-based analytical version of the percolation model, we extract the defect generation efficiency responsible for breakdown. Following a review of different breakdown mechanisms and models, we discuss how the release of hydrogen through the coupling between vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom can explain the power-law dependence of defect generation efficiency. On the basis of these results, a unified and global picture of oxide breakdown is constructed and the resulting model is applied to project reliability limits. In this regard, it is concluded that SiO2-based dielectrics can provide reliable gate dielectric, even to a thickness of 1nm, and that CMOS scaling may well be viable for the 50nm technology node.},

Design rules, operating voltages, frequencies, and temperatures are precisely chosen to ensure correct product functional operation over its intended lifetime. Thus, in order to obtain the overall performance and functionality bounded by various design and manufacturing constraints, the integrated circuit reliability must be modeled and analyzed at the very beginning of design stages. This paper reviews some of the most important intrinsic wearout mechanisms of MOSFETs (including hot-carrier injection, time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and negative bias temperature instability) and introduces new accelerated-lifetime and SPICE compact models of these wearout mechanisms. Based on these circuit-aging models, a new SPICE reliability simulation approach is proposed and demonstrated with a simplified SRAM design on a commercial 90-nm technology to help designers understand device-failure behaviors, predict circuit reliability, and improve product robustness.},

Increased MTBF numbers translate into enhanced availability and better operational reliability. This is essential for building highly dependable computing systems. This paper briefly reviews the steps required for achieving successful prognostics. The lessons learned from adopting EP to the previous and current generations of enterprise computing systems have influenced the next generation computer system designs, equipping future systems with more advanced capabilities for electronic prognostics. Sun Microsystems' new continuous system telemetry harness (CSTH) coupled with advanced pattern recognition substantially increases component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing (through improved root cause analysis) costly sources of "no trouble found" events.

Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT:The relative abilities of 2, dimensioned statistics—the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE)—to describe average model-performance error are examined. The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

@article{Chai2014,
	abstract = {Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) are regularly employed in model evaluation studies. Willmott and Matsuura (2005) have sug-gested that the RMSE is not a good indicator of average model performance and might be a misleading indicator of average error, and thus the MAE would be a better metric for that purpose. While some concerns over using RMSE raised by Willmott and Matsuura (2005) and Willmott et al. (2009) are valid, the proposed avoidance of RMSE in favor of MAE is not the solution. Citing the aforementioned papers, many researchers chose MAE over RMSE to present their model evaluation statistics when presenting or adding the RMSE measures could be more beneficial. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its mean-ing, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model perfor-mance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satis-fies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric, whereas Willmott et al. (2009) indicated that the sums-of-squares-based statistics do not satisfy this rule. In the end, we discussed some circumstances where using the RMSE will be more beneficial. However, we do not contend that the RMSE is superior over the MAE. Instead, a combination of metrics, including but certainly not limited to RMSEs and MAEs, are often required to assess model performance.},
