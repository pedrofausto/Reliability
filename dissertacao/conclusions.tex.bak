\chapter{Conclus√µes}

The CMOS supremacy in the framework of ASIC design has been threatened by challenges mainly related to the alarming pace of the increase of power consumption, as consequence of the scaling process. The size reduction of transistors shall not continue to occur uninterruptedly, due to physical limits and technology issues. Considering that, researchers worldwide are looking forward to find viable solutions that could slow down the reaching of CMOS miniaturization limits or even replace the current state-of-art technology.
