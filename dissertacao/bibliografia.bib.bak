abstract = {Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) models for silica(SiO2){-}based dielectrics are revisited so as to better understand the ability of each model to explain quantitatively the generally accepted TDDB observations. Molecular dielectric degradation models, which lead to percolation path generation and eventual TDDB failure, tend to fall into three broad categories: field-based models, current-based models, and complementary combinations of field and current-based models. A complementary combination of field-induced polar-bond stretching and current-induced bond-catalysis seems to be required, at the molecular level, to explain the generally accepted TDDB observations. Thus, TDDB modeling is not simply the use of field or current {–} but both. Complementary combinations of field and current are required to fully explain the generally accepted TDDB observations.},

abstract = {Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and channel hot carrier (CHC) are the leading reliability concerns for nanoscale transistors. The de facto modeling method to analyze CHC is based on substrate current Isub, which becomes increasingly problematic with technology scaling as various leakage components dominate Isub. In this paper, we present a unified approach that directly predicts the change of key transistor parameters under various process and design conditions for both NBTI and CHC effects. Using the general reaction-diffusion model and the concept of surface potential, the proposed method continuously captures the performance degradation across subthreshold and strong inversion regions. Models are comprehensively verified with an industrial 65-nm technology. By benchmarking the prediction of circuit performance degradation with the measured ring oscillator data and simulations of an amplifier, we demonstrate that the proposed method very well predicts the degradation. For 65-nm technology, NBTI is the dominant reliability concern, and the impact of CHC on circuit performance is relatively small.},

@book{Sorin2009,
abstract = {Abstract For many years, most computer architects have pursued one primary goal: performance. Architects have translated the ever-increasing abundance of ever-faster transistors provided by Moore's law into remarkable increases in performance. Recently, however, the bounty provided by Moore's law has been accompanied by several challenges that have arisen as devices have become smaller, including a decrease in dependability due to physical faults. In this book, we focus on the dependability challenge and the fault tolerance solutions that architects are developing to overcome it. The two main purposes of this book are to explore the key ideas in fault-tolerant computer architecture and to present the current state-of-the-art - over approximately the past 10 years - in academia and industry.

abstract = {Software reliability engineering is focused on engineering techniques for developing and maintaining software systems whose reliability can be quantitatively evaluated. In order to estimate as well as to predict the reliability of software systems, failure data need to be properly measured by various means during software development and operational phases. Moreover, credible software reliability models are required to track underlying software failure processes for accurate reliability analysis and forecasting. Although software reliability has remained an active research subject over the past 35 years, challenges and open questions still exist. In particular, vital future goals include the development of new software reliability engineering paradigms that take software architectures, testing techniques, and software failure manifestation mechanisms into consideration. In this paper, we review the history of software reliability engineering, the current trends and existing problems, and specific difficulties. Possible future directions and promising research subjects in software reliability engineering are also addressed.},

abstract = {Reliability is a popular concept that has been celebrated for years as a commendable attribute of a person or an artifact. From its modest beginning in 1816-the word reliability was first coined by Samuel T. Coleridge-reliability grew into an omnipresent attribute with qualitative and quantitative connotations that pervades every aspect of our present day technologically intensive world. In this short communication, we highlight key events and the history of ideas that led to the birth of Reliability Engineering, and its development in the subsequent decades. We first argue that statistics and mass production were the enablers in the rise of this new discipline, and the catalyst that accelerated the coming of this new discipline was the (unreliability of the) vacuum tube. We highlight the foundational role of AGREE report in 1957 in the birth of reliability engineering, and discuss the consolidation of numerous efforts in the 1950s into a coherent new technical discipline. We show that an evolution took place in the discipline in the following two decades along two directions: first, there was an increased specialization in the discipline (increased sophistication of statistical techniques, and the rise of a new branch focused on the actual physics of failure of components, Reliability Physics); second, there occurred a shift in the emphasis of the discipline from a component-centric to an emphasis on system-level attributes (system reliability, availability, safety). Finally, in selecting the particular events and highlights in the history of ideas that led to the birth and subsequent development of reliability engineering, we acknowledge a subjective component in this work and make no claims to exhaustiveness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical compo-nents such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the in-fluence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.},

abstract = {Semiconductor chips are used today not only to control systems, but also to protect them against security threats. A continuous battle is waged between manufacturers who invent new security solutions, learning their lessons from previous mistakes, and the hacker community, constantly trying to break implemented protections. Some chip manufacturers do not pay enough attention to the proper design and testing of protection mechanisms. Even where they claim their products are highly secure, they do not guarantee this and do not take any responsibility if a device is compromised. In this situation, it is crucial for the design engineer to have a convenient and reliable method of testing secure chips. This thesis presents a wide range of attacks on hardware security in microcontrollers and smartcards. This includes already known non-invasive attacks, such as power analysis and glitching, and invasive attacks, such as reverse engineering and microprobing. A new class of attacks – semi-invasive attacks – is introduced. Like invasive attacks, they require depackaging the chip to get access to its surface. But the passivation layer remains intact, as these methods do not require electrical contact to internal lines. Semi-invasive attacks stand between noninvasive and invasive attacks. They represent a greater threat to hardware security, as they are almost as effective as invasive attacks but can be low-cost like non-invasive attacks. This thesis' contribution includes practical fault-injection attacks to modify SRAM and EEPROM content, or change the state of any individual CMOS transistor on a chip. This leads to almost unlimited capabilities to control chip operation and circumvent protection mechanisms. A second contribution consist of experiments on data remanence, which show that it is feasible to extract information from powered-off SRAM and erased EPROM, EEPROM and Flash memory devices. A brief introduction to copy protection in microcontrollers is given. Hardware security evaluation techniques using semi-invasive methods are introduced. They should help developers to make a proper selection of components according to the required level of security. Various defence technologies are discussed, from low-cost obscurity methods to new approaches in silicon design.},

Different from most existing work that exploits emerging technologies for hardware security, we (i) focus on transistor characteristics that either do not exist in, or are difficult to duplicate with MOSFETs, and (ii) aim to move beyond hardware implementations of physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and random number generators (RNGs).},

abstract = {Channel hot-carrier degradation presents a renewed interest in the last NMOS nodes where the device reliability of bulk silicon (core) 40 nm and Input/Output (IO) device is difficult to achieve at high temperature as a function of supply voltage VDD and back bias V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. A three mode interface trap generation is proposed based on the energy acquisition involved in distinct interactions in all the V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) conditions as a single I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} lifetime dependence is observed with V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}GD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} {\&}gt; 0. This gives a new age(t) function useful for accurate DC to AC transfers. Positive temperature activation is explained by the rise of ionization rate with electron-electron scattering (medium I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and multi vibrational excitation (higher I{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) which increase the H desorption by thermal emission. The use of forward VBS has shown no gain under CHC for both device types. The main limitation occurs under reverse V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = -V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} in IO where the smaller temperature activation partially compensates the larger damage. In that case a security margin can be established giving a limit of V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = -V{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DD{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}/2 for design reliability.},

abstract = {This volume addresses the issues related to hot-carrier reliability of MOS VLSI circuits, ranging from device physics to circuit design guidelines. It presents a unified view of the physical mechanisms involved in hot-carrier induced device degradation, the prevalent models for these mechanisms, and simulation methods for estimating hot-carrier effects in the circuit environment. The newly emerging approaches to the VLSI design-for-reliability and rule-based reliability diagnosis are also discussed in detail. Hot-Carrier Reliability of MOS VLSI Circuits is primarily for use by engineers and scientists who study device and circuit-level reliability in VLSI systems and develop practical reliability measures and models. VLSI designers will benefit from this book since it offers a comprehensive overview of the interacting mechanisms that influence hot-carrier reliability, and also provides useful guidelines for reliable VLSI design.

abstract = {The scaling trends in CMOS technology and operating conditions give rise to serious degradation mechanisms such as Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) in MOSFETs, threatening the circuit and product lifetimes. The aging phenomena, on top of process variations, translate into complexity and reduced design margin for circuits. International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors mentions reliability as one of the "Design Technology Challenges" and calls attention to "Design for Reliability." In order to increase the overall design efficiency, it is important to (i) understand MOSFET-level degradation, (ii) develop physically robust compact models compatible with circuit simulators, and (iii) implementing tools that incorporate NBTI and HCI reliability into VLSI design process at an early stage. In this work, NBTI and HCI degradation and their implications on MOSFET and circuit reliability are studied. Transistor-level NBTI degradation is explored and experimentally calibrated voltage, temperature, and time dependences are obtained. Recovery characteristics, degradation under AC and random activity relations are derived. Implications for aggressively-scaled and non-planar MOSFET geometries are discussed. With comprehensive experimental and theoretical tools, HCI degradation is investigated, particularly for short channel MOSFETs with lower operating conditions. HCI issues that are unclear in the literature are resolved. The interface trap generation under HCI is linked to NBTI theory, thus degradation of circuits experiencing both mechanisms can be assessed efficiently. Finally, compact reliability models for MOSFETs are presented so that this framework can be applied to digital and analog circuits as well as memory circuits.},

This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of mission critical applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind.
